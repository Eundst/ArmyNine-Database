    <h3> Introduction:</h3>
    <p>Hellow everyone, my name is Steven. I am 16 years old. <br> My main interests are music, 
        game and basic knowledge of technologies. I like listen to synthwave musics which
        were popular at the 90s'.<br>  The synthesizer can always calm me down when I was anxious. 
        I also like to play games related to history, middle age and religions.<br> The knight's shinning armor and 
        waving swords always make me obsessed and respectful.
    </p>
    <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <p> I also like animals. I have two cats. They currently lived at Wuhan. I always miss them and 
        want to stroke them on the head. Swimming is my favourite sport. I love the feeling of wandering in the 
        crystal water without gravity.<br> I like to make friends and hear stories. 
    </p>
